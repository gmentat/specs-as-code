# Sample Spec

## Goal

Provide a minimal, concrete example of a spec folder that follows the spec folder contract.

## Non-goals

- Implementing application code.

## Behavior

- This spec folder demonstrates the required files and frontmatter.
- It is listed in `specs/INDEX.md`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Folder contains `spec.md`, `how-to-test.md`, `changelog.md`
- [ ] `spec.md` has valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Spec is listed in `specs/INDEX.md`

## Notes

- This repo is a template; projects should replace this with real specs.
